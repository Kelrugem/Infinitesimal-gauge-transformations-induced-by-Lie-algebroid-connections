# Infinitesimal-gauge-transformations-induced-by-Lie-algebroid-connections

The notion of action Lie algebroids contains information about Lie algebras and their actions,
which is why it is natural to generalise gauge theories to a formulation using Lie algebroids;
these allow structure functions in general. This is for example done in the formulation
of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theory, formulated by Alexei Kotov and Thomas Strobl.
We will discuss how to formulate infinitesimal gauge transformations using Lie algebroids in
such a way that these close as algebra. For this we are going to generalise infinitesimal gauge
transformations of Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theories to derivations on vector bundle V-valued
functionals. In the context of gauge theory, we will motivate that those vector bundles V
will be the pullback of another bundle W, and the gauge transformations as derivations will
be induced by a Lie algebroid connection on W, using a more general notion of pullback
connections. This also supports the usage of arbitrary types of connections on W in the definition
of the infinitesimal gauge transformation, not just canonical flat ones as in the classical
formulation. As usual, these derivations are parametrised and their parameters have to be
generalised to functionals, especially the parameters themselves can have a non-trivial gauge
transformation. We then discuss under which conditions this algebra of derivations gives a
closed algebra, also by providing a natural Lie bracket on the space of parameters, and we
are going to see that closure is strongly related to the vanishing of a tensor known as the
basic curvature.
